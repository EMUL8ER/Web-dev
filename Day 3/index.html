        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I did my Btech from IIPE,Vizag, although I majored in petroleum engineering with a good CGPA
            of 8.87/10, but I  seem to have found my Knack for tech, I was introduced to C language, data structures and algorithms,
            OOP, in college itself and in my last semester, I was taught Python, Warehousing concepts and Machine Learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was amazing, I enjoyed alot and also used it to build my final year project on lithology prediction using random Forest algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently I came across some creators on YT, and learned about Open Source, I wanted to be useful to community and am looking to get started in open source development
            and as a first step, I am  learning web development alongside my full time job as a data analyst (which I completely enjoy).
            As the part of challenge I will be building my portfolio website, using frontend technologies.
