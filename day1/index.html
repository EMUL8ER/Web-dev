    <H1>About Me</H1>
    <p>Hi, I am shashwat, I did my Btech from IIPE,Vizag, although I majored in petroleum engineering with a good CGPA
        of 8.87/10, but I  seem to have found my Knack for tech, I was introduced to C language, data structures and algorithms,
        OOP, in college itself and in my last semester, I was taught Python, Warehousing concepts and Machine Learning, It was amazing, I enjoyed alot and also
        used it to build my final year project on lithology prediction using random Forest algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently I came across some creators on YT, and learned about Open Source,I wanted to be useful to community and am looking to get started in open source development
        and as a first step, I am  learning web development alongside my full time job as a data analyst (which I completely enjoy).
        As the part of challenge I will be building my portfolio website, using frontend technologies.
